Library for expressing quantities and units of measurement in Scala in a type safe manner, where the compiler checks that assignments and calculations with the units are correct.

Based on and inspired by existing code for Church Numerals in Scala.
See e.g.:
http://jim-mcbeath.blogspot.com/2008/11/practical-church-numerals-in-scala.html

Contains code adapted from the Metascala library (http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/metascala) by Jesper Nordenberg.

The main difference of ScalaQuantity from Metascala is a focus on just quantities.
